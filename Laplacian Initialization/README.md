# Laplacian Initialization

Please visit the GitHub https://github.com/HazyResearch/KGEmb for installation instructutions, dependencies, and information about running.

## Running

All code is linked to my Google Drive, therefore to use it you must change the directory.

1) Get the Laplacian Embeddings using Lap_init.ipynb, which will save a .npy file
2) Use colab_run to start training, and results are recorded in the logs folder
3) To use Laplacian initialization for training, use the arg --lap_path and set it to the directory for the .npy file
